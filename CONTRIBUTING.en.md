# Contributing

**[한국어](CONTRIBUTING.md)** · English

One rule covers this repo: **back your claims with evidence.** Contributors are held to the same standard the plugin holds Claude to.

Everyone taking part follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development setup

You need `bash`, `python3`, and Claude Code. It runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows — Windows through Git Bash.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsthisLee/claude-grounded
cd claude-grounded
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # blocks commits carrying personal paths
claude --plugin-dir .                 # load this folder in that session instead of the installed copy
```

## Checks

Run them before and after your change.

```bash
for g in lib no-guess-gate done-gate test-integrity project-guard repo-profile; do tests/$g/unit.sh; done
tests/skills-unit.sh && tests/attack-surface.sh && tests/invariants.sh
tests/fuzz.sh                                  # malformed input against every hook
shellcheck -x -s bash plugin/hooks/*/*.sh tests/*.sh tests/*/*.sh
python3 -m py_compile plugin/hooks/no-guess-gate/judge.py
claude plugin validate . --strict
```

Two suites call a model and take minutes, so they are not in CI:

```bash
tests/no-guess-gate/selftest.sh         # 12 real-prompt regressions
tests/no-guess-gate/judge-accuracy.sh   # judge accuracy and latency
```

CI runs syntax checks, `shellcheck -x`, actionlint, and the unit suites on ubuntu, macos, and windows. **If you touched the gate's decision logic, run the model-calling suites yourself and paste the results into the PR.**

## Changing a gate rule

1. **Write the test first.** Add the case to the relevant `unit.sh` and watch it go RED. A test that never fails protects nothing.
2. Implement, then confirm the whole suite passes.
3. If you touched the judge, run `selftest.sh` as well.
4. Record **the command you ran and its raw output** in `docs/VERIFICATION.md`. "I checked it" is not a record.

A new rule or exemption **must be grounded in official or verified documentation.** Quote the sentence in the PR body. If there is no such source, say so and explain why the rule is needed anyway — an ungrounded rule is the very thing this plugin exists to block.

When fixing a false positive, bring the case that triggered it. The matching line from `events.log` is enough.

## Commits and PRs

Commit messages are `type(scope): summary`, with the body saying what changed and why. If a measurement drove the change, give the number.

Attach the output of the checks you ran. Do not open a pull request with code you have not reviewed yourself.

## What must not be committed

`.githooks/pre-commit` blocks commits containing home paths, email addresses, or private paths. Turn it on with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` and it catches the slip for you. If it blocks something you believe is a false positive, open an issue rather than reaching for `--no-verify`.
