# Choose what to enforce

Let me pick, check by check, what claude-grounded enforces in this repo. **Everything starts on.** Turning something off is a decision written into `.grounded.toml`, so it shows up in the pull request and the team can see it.

**Reply in whatever language I am writing to you in,** and write config comments in that language.

## 1. Read the current state

Read `.grounded.toml` at the repo root. Take the `disabled_rules` line if there is one. **That line is the only thing this command changes.** Leave every other key and comment exactly as it is.

Check the environment too. If `NGG_DONE`, `NGG_TESTGUARD`, `NGG_GUARD` or `NGG_JUDGE` is `0`, that switch turns a whole gate off regardless of the file. Say so.

## 2. Show every item

One table: gate, name, what it blocks, where the rule comes from, and whether it is on right now. Use these rows.

| Gate | Name | Blocks | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Evidence | `R0` | Answering about this repo's state without running a tool | Reduce hallucinations |
| Evidence | `R1` | Asserting a file's state without looking | Reduce hallucinations |
| Evidence | `R2a` | Ending on "this needs to be verified" without running a tool | Reduce hallucinations, "Allow Claude to say I don't know" (deferring what could be checked is not the same) |
| Evidence | `R2b` | Guessing at local state ("probably") | Reduce hallucinations |
| Evidence | `R3` | Claiming tests passed with zero Bash calls | Best practices |
| Evidence | `R4` | Ending again with no tool call after a block | Reduce hallucinations |
| Evidence | `R5` | Claiming success when the last command failed | Hooks docs, built on the `PostToolUseFailure` event |
| Completion | `done.turn` | Ending a turn that changed code before the check passes | Best practices, "As a deterministic gate: a Stop hook runs your check as a script and blocks the turn from ending until it passes." |
| Completion | `done.commit` | Committing before the full check passes | Kent Beck, "Only commit when ALL tests are passing." |
| Completion | `done.pr` | Opening a PR whose body has no command output | Best practices, "Have Claude show evidence rather than asserting success" |
| Test integrity | `ti.skip` | Adding `.skip`-style markers to tests | Kent Beck, "disabling or deleting tests" |
| Test integrity | `ti.assert` | Removing assertions | Kent Beck, same sentence |
| Test integrity | `ti.rm` | Deleting test files | Kent Beck, same sentence |
| Test integrity | `ti.exclude` | Adding exclusions to test-runner config | EvilGenie (arXiv 2511.21654), "Modified Testing Procedures" |
| Project guard | `pg.noverify` | `git commit --no-verify` when commit hooks exist | No external source. Skipping the repo's own checks is a human's call |

Append-only paths have no name here. They are on only when `append_only` is set, and `/grounded:init` handles that.

## 3. Ask what to turn off

Use `AskUserQuestion` with multi-select, one question per gate, listing that gate's items. The question is **which to turn off**, not which to keep. It allows at most four options per question, so split the evidence gate's seven rules across two questions. If I only want to change one gate, ask about that one.

Before asking, say this once: for a single false positive, writing `grounded allow <item>` on its own line in the next prompt lets one action through without turning anything off. That does not cover `R0`–`R5`.

## 4. Write it

Show the `disabled_rules` line before and after, and get a yes before writing. Then:

- If the file exists, replace that one line, or add it if it was missing.
- If the file does not exist, create it with that line and a one-line comment saying why.
- If nothing is off anymore, remove the line.

Names are comma-separated and case does not matter. Do not write a name that is not in the table above; the gates report unknown names but turn nothing off.

## 5. Report

The same table as step 2, with the new state. Then say where the change will be visible: in the diff of `.grounded.toml`, in the repo profile at the start of every session, and as `off=[...]` in `events.log` whenever a disabled check would have blocked.
